# Confluent Secrets Provider

version 1.0.7, updated April 4, 2023

## Introduction

With a typical Confluent Kafka Platform installation, secrets are stored within that cluster only.

This CSID Accelerator enables use of external third-party systems for securely storing and retrieving key/value pairs, commonly used for passwords, for example.
In some cases, this can be used to store symmetric keys and asymmetric (public/private) keys.

* [Hashicorp Vault](vault)
* [AWS Secrets Manager](aws)
* [Google Secret Manager](gcloud)
* [Microsoft Azure Key Vault](azure)
* [Kubernetes Secrets](k8s)
* [File System](common)

# Implementation

## How should I implement this library?

A complete setup of Confluent Secrets will go through the following phases:

1.  Installation of the libraries
2.  Creation and installation of the property files
3.  Restart of the components and health check
4.  Test of the added functionality

## Installation: What files do I need, and where do I put them?

The Confluent Secrets Providers Accelerator is provided as Java jar libraries to be installed in your Java class path.

Note: ordering of libraries in Java class path is important.
Accelerator libraries such as this should be loaded first.

Note: it is not recommended to install libraries for multiple components sharing a node (e.g. Schema Registry and Connect).

If necessary, then use separate class paths to be explicit for each component.

## Installation in the Java class path

Using the table below, copy the libraries required by your use case into your existing class path or a new folder.

The class search path (class path) can be set using either the `-classpath` option when calling a JDK tool (the preferred method) or by setting the `CLASSPATH` environment variable.

The `-classpath` option is preferred because you can set it individually for each application without affecting other applications and without other applications modifying its value.

## Installation via the CLI

Update the following with the specific provider to be installed:

```bash
confluent-hub install confluentinc/csid-config-provider-aws:latest
```
